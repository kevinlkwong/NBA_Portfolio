Portfolio Project - NBA 

This is my first self-directed portfolio project, where I took a raw dataset containing data about the NBA from Kaggle and conducted an analysis on it with SQL and Tableau.

Questions I tried to answer in my analysis:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

I set up a Postgres server on my personal computer and scrubbed the datasets prior to importing them. I removed all rows that included tm (team) = 'TOT'  I had trouble importing the datasets directly so I created the tables and imported the datasets in.
