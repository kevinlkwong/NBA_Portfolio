Portfolio Project - NBA 

This is my first self-directed portfolio project where I took a raw NBA dataset from Kaggle and conducted an analysis on it with SQL and Tableau. I set up a PostgresSQL server on my personal laptop and imported the CSV files.  All data cleanup was done through SQL.  As the 2022 NBA season was not over when I first downloaded the dataset, I updated the results in SQL and used the most up to date dataset. I also combined different permutations of the same team into a more consistent name so avoid skewing the results from my queries.

I exported all my query results into CSV files and uploaded them onto Tableau to build my dashboard.

Questions I tried to answer in my analysis:

1. Is the Western Conference that much better than the Eastern Conference?

- Number of championships per conference
- Total number of wins by team

2. How has the game changed over the last two decades?

- Pace
- Offensive Rating
- Defensive Rating
- 3P/2P shot distribution

I had opted not to use some of the queries as it did not fit with the general theme of my Dashboard. Since this is my first project I thought it would make more sense to have a high level look over the last 2 decades and save some of the queries for future projects instead.
