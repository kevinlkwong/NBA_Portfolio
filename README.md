Portfolio Project - NBA 

This is my first self-directed portfolio project where I took a raw NBA dataset from Kaggle and conducted an analysis on it with SQL and Tableau.

Questions I tried to answer in my analysis:

1. Is the Western Conference that much better than the Eastern Conference?

- Average Wins / Loss for each conferernce
- Which conference wins more Championships

2. How has the game changed over the last two decade?

- Pace, Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, 3PA/2PA distribution
